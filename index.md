## Currently
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Entomology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  I'm interested in questions pertaining to how bumble bee behavior, colony fitness, populations, and communities respond to landscape-scale flower availability over space and time.  Outside of my professional pursuits, I am a photographer, climbing routesetter, and a budding wine aficionado.

## Projects
### Bumble bees of Wisconsin
Interest in bumble bee conservation is at an all time high.  Each week I meet citizens concerned about our fuzzy friends - interseted in learning more to help with conservation efforts.  To help further cultivate interest in bumble bees, and to share important information about their biology, conservation, and to help amateur naturalists identify Wisconsin bumble bees, I built a website.  _(www.wisconsinbumblebees.com)_.  

### Insect photography
We entomologists have the benefit of studying some of the most beautiful organisms on the planet.  I do my best to capture that beauty, and that of the environments in which insects live, to share with people I meet throughout my academic journey. _(www.jeremyhemberger.com/gallery)_.
